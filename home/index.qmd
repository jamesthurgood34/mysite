## 🖥️ Machine Learning Engineer

Welcome to my corner of the web! I'm James, a machine engineer with a passion for using technology to drive efficiency and value.

### 💼 Professional Overview
Currently working NatWest driving value through use of generative AI.

I thrive on tackling interesting, novel challenges that push the boundaries of what's possible with technology.

### 🌄 Beyond the Code
When I'm not immersed in data and algorithms, you'll likely find me:

- 🏃‍♂️ Running trails (I've completed two marathons!)
- 🏔️ Climbing Munros in Scotland
- 🏕️ Seeking out new outdoor adventures

### 🤝 Let's Connect
Whether you're interested in discussing potential collaborations, sharing ideas about machine learning applications, or swapping stories about outdoor escapades, I'm always open to connecting with like-minded individuals.
